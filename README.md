# Text-Compressor
A course project for CSS 325 - Data Structures

This is an example program that will compress some given text files. Included is a text file of "War and Peace", which is an incredibly long book. Running the program ("java Main" from /bin/) will encode the text file into a compressed version using a hash table (the code for the structure created from scratch), and decode it to compare to the original copy, along with reporting time elapsed and other statistics.
